       OPERATIONAL PLAN 
            FOR 

   WEATHER MODIFICATION. PROJECT 
SOUTHWEST KANSAS WEATHER MODIFICATION 

            2002

 1.0 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DISTRICT 

 Western Kansas Groundwater Management District #1 (WKGMD #1) is planning 
 to conduct a cloud seeding program in Southwestern and West-Central Kansas 
in 2002. This is a continuation of the project WESTERN KANSAS WEATHER 
 MODIFICATION PROGRAM which has been conducted during the growing 
 seasons from 1975 through 2001. In 2002, 14    Western Kansas counties 
 entered into an agreement with WKGMD #1 to jointly finance weather 
modification operations. Planning and management responsibilities rest with the 
WKGMD #1 at Scott City.      Daily decision-making and execution of this 
 operational plan will be the responsibility of the Program Director. 

 The primary objective of the program is to conduct rain augmentation and hail 
 suppression operations from April 22nd through September 20th 2002. 
 Operations in the specified area will be accomplished by (1) direct injection of 
dry ice into clouds, (2) vaporizing ice-forming nucleants into cloud base updrafts 
(both as a liquid solution and as a solid pyrotechnic), and (3) pyrotechnic 
generation of hygroscopic nuclei into cloud base undrafts. 

A secondary objective is to acquire data related to seeding operations and storm 
activity. The data will be stored in a form suitable for later analysis. 

 2.0 OPERATING AREA 

      2.1 Primary Target Area 

 The primary cloud seeding target is comprised of the unshaded group of 
counties which are surrounded by the shaded area of influence shown on page 
2, Figure 1. 

       2.2 Area of Influence 

In the normal conduct of seeding operations it is expected that seeding material 
released will occur upwind of the intended target area and that some of the 
seeding effects may extend downwind of the primary target. From the foregoing, 
when considering prevailing winds, it can reasonably be expected that the area 
of influence would be approximately 10 miles upwind and 25 miles downwind of 
the primary target shown as the shaded area on page 2, Figure 1.

 3.0 EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES 

       3.1 Operations Center 

Primary operations and control activities will be conducted in the project field 
headquarters located at the Kearny County Airport in Lakin. This building will 
house the radar system, accommodate the weather analysis function and serve 
as project administrative offices. 

      3.2 Seeding Aircraft 

 Two single-engine Piper Comanche aircraft and one twin-engine Baron will be 
used for updraft (cloud base) seeding, whereas, on-top seeding will be 
conducted by a twin-engine Piper Cheyenne aircraft. All aircraft are currently 
owned and maintained by WKGMD #1. It is proposed that cloud base aircraft 
will be located at the airfields in Leoti, Syracuse, and Lakin. The cloud top 
 aircraft will be based in Scott City. 

All aircraft will operate in the FAA "Restricted" category and certified airworthy 
under the appropriate FAA regulations. 

       3.3 Seeding Devices 

All cloud base aircraft will be equipped with a Carley-type silver iodide-acetone 
burning generator mounted on each wing tip.   The cloud base aircraft will 
operate from April 22nd through September 20, 2002. Each generator will 
dispense a three percent (by weight) silver iodide solution at a rate of (2.0 
gallons per hour). All of the cloud base aircraft will also carry a special holding 
rack attached to the trailing edge of both wings, each of which is capable of 
carrying 12 pyrotechnic devices (flares) of the end-burning, burn-in-place 
variety. These flares are designed to produce hygroscopic ice-forming nuclei 
which promote the condensation-freezing-coalescence process within clouds. 

Another pyrotechnic device produces purely hygroscopic nuclei and is used in 
rainfall augmentation in generally smaller, "warm" clouds. These devices are 
end-burning and burn-in-place in the wing racks. The nuclei produced by the 
hygroscopic flares promote rapid hygroscopic growth into larger water droplets 
within clouds which subsequently falls, scavenging other drops along its path. 

The cloud-top aircraft will serve as the direct injection seeding aircraft. It will 
dispense dry ice at a rate of 2.27 kg (5 lb) per minute into new-growth cloud 

                                  3 
<<<

turrets. This aircraft will be equipped with a full complement of avionics and 
weather avoidance radar for night IFR flights. 

       3.4 Seeding Material 

When silver iodide complexes are burned by seeding aircraft at cloud bases, 
ice-forming nuclei are generated in updrafts while seeding both for hail 
suppression and rainfall augmentation. Seeding dispersal will be continuous 
while in areas of updrafts of approximately 200 feet per minute, or more. 

Similarly, nuclei from pure hygroscopic material will be generated continuously 
in some seeding cases. The most important property of such nuclei is that they 
vigorously attract cloud water and water vapor to themselves and rapidly grow to 
become relatively large water droplets eliminating the need for those nuclei to 
ascend very far into sub-freezing cloud levels before producing the desired 
effect from clouds. 

In both the above cases the aircraft will travel the full length of the updraft in the 
zones of "new growth" to obtain maximum dispersion of the seeding in use within 
the updraft volume. See Figure 2 on page 5. 

Dry ice (CO 2) will be the exclusive seeding material used by the on-top aircraft. 
Dry ice pellets are approximately 20 mm in size (0.4 inch) and will be dispensed 
from a flight level equivalent to -10 C. Dispersal will be continuous while over, or 
in, new-growth clouds being treated both for hail suppression and rainfall 
augmentation. 

      3.5 Communications 

Ground-to-air communications will be accomplished using the FM frequency 
155.1 MHz. The FM base stations and VHF transceivers will be located at the 
field headquarters in Lakin.   Aircraft will transmit on the VHF mulit-com 
frequency 122.925 MHz when above the altitude authorized for transmitting on 
the FM frequency. The Project Manager will utilize the FM transmitters as the 
primary system to communicate with the aircraft but use the VHF channel to 
listen to communications from the pilots. Voice transmission on the VHF 
channel will be used only as a backup means of communications. 

Five commercial telephone lines will be installed at the field headquarters. The 
lines will be used in the following manner: 
      (a) two for alerting aircrews and general administration, 
      (b) two will be a data lines dedicated to accessing meteorological 
      information via modem, 
      (c) one will be a fax line and occasionally used as an internet line.

All pilots will have a commercial phone installed in his living quarters. All 
personnel in the program will be furnished communications particulars for all of 
the other personnel associated with the program. In addition, each pilot will 
obtain a paging phone system for his local area to keep with him at all times 
when away from his commercial phone. 

      3.6 Weather Radar 

Storm monitoring and seeding control will be with a C-Band radar system located 
at the Lakin field headquarters. The radar system has PPI and RHI presentation 
capability and is interfaced to a digital processor which can be command to 
display intensity-contoured cloud echoes (both vertical and horizontal) on a 
computer monitor showing distance and direction from the radar to the given 
cloud system. The antenna system for tracking aircraft is an L-Band IFF aircraft 
transponder/decoder system which is physically mounted to the C-Band radar 
antenna for synchronous timing to the weather radar antenna. The IFF system 
will discretely track up to six aircraft showing the position of each on the radar 
PPI display relative to weather echoes. 

      3.7 Other Data Collection Equipment 

Weather data are collected from two sources: 

(1) DUATS (Direct User Access Terminal System) - the federally provided flight 
planning service provided to all pilots. Among the weather data collected by 
modem from DUATS are surface observations, forecasts for surface stations, 
upper air prognostications, weather warnings and synoptic discussions. 

(2) INTERNET - the same upper air data, satellite data and standard charts 
prepared by the National Weather Service are available on a timely basis. 
Updated data also appear frequently on a host of web sites. One such hourly 
update obtained is of wind profilers at Granada, CO and Haviland, KS thereby 
providing us important and timely wind profiles of the atmosphere at both the 
eastern and western sides of our target area. Another important update 
available every 15 minutes is of cloud satellite imagery. 

The daily weather data products used in weather forecasting and updates are 
archived on computer files. Much of the "hardcopy" data printed out are kept in 
file folders, one for each day of the season, along with radar logs and press 
information. 

                                6

4.0 PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES 

      4.1 Policy Board 

A decision and policy making board has been established in order to ensure that 
the desires of the local users are considered in the proposed weather 
modification operations. The board is made up of one representative from each 
of the participating counties plus the Manager for the Western Kansas 
Groundwater Management District #1. Kansas Water Office personnel will serve 
as state liaison to the policy board. The Program Manager, being the licensee, 
also will act as the technical advisor. 

The policy board will meet periodically, or confer through telephone calls, during 
the season as needed to assess the operations and determine future policy. 
The members will be responsible for keeping the Operations Center advised of 
soil moisture and crop condition changes as well as seeding priority changes for 
their respective counties. In addition, they will be asked to provide input on the 
suspension of seeding and reports of weather-related conditions that have 
occurred in their counties. 

4.2 General Priorities 

Since the same organization and resources are used to accomplish both rain 
augmentation and hail suppression, priorities will be adjusted by the Policy 
Board as necessary, depending on soil moisture and crop vulnerability to hail 
damage.   Since rainfall stimulation and hail reduction both result from a 
discretionary decision-making process during the period of operations, emphasis 
will be on hail reduction; rain augmentation will be a secondary objective. 
Seeding to increase rainfall may be performed first, but often the storm day 
transitions with the atmosphere becoming more unstable making necessary a 
change of seeding mode into hail suppression. Similarly, at the end of hail 
suppression operations rainfall stimulation can often be performed for a period 
of time before all seedable convective clouds collapse. 

5.0 SEEDING OPERATIONS 

The responsibility for day-to-day seeding decisions rests with the Program 
Manager. The decisions will be based on priority guidelines set by the Policy 
Board and on existing meteorological conditions. The basic meteorological 
criteria used to initiate or suspend seeding operations are outlined in the 
following paragraphs. 

                                  7 
<<<

       5.1 Seeding Criteria 

 The criteria for selecting suitable cloud systems for seeding will be based on an 
 assessment of a multiple number of meteorological parameters. All significant 
 cloud systems will be examined for seeding potential. Seeding.will be initiated 
 on the basis of the general criteria listed in Table 1 on page 10. 

       5.2 Suspension Criteria 

 Seeding to increase rain either will not be initiated, or will be suspended when 
excessive rain is likely to occur. The Project Manager will take cognizance of 
the sociological aspects of seeding when severe storms are forecasted or when 
they are in progress. However, hail suppression operations will be conducted 
when beneficial results appear attainable as long as flying safety is not 
jeopardized. 

Rain augmentation operations will be suspended when soil moisture is 
adequate, as determined by the Policy Board. Also, no seeding will be initiated 
at times the Policy Board determines weather modification activities are not 
beneficial to a particular area. 

In the event there is a threat of damaging floods from excessive rainfall in the 
project area or in the area of influence, no seeding will be initiated. If seeding is 
in progress, it will be suspended by the Project Manager as soon as the 
hazardous potential becomes known. 

      5.3. Meteorological Data 

Since 1995 the Internet has played an increasingly important role as a supplier 
of meteorological data to the Western Kansas Weather Modification Program. 
The types and sources of all meteorological data routinely available to the field 
headquarters include: 

      a. Hourly observations - DUATS and Internet 

      b. Aviation Terminal Forecasts - DUATS and Internet 

      c. Severe Weather Warnings - DUATS and public news media 

      d. Synoptic Surface and Upper Air Analyses - DUATS and Internet 

      e. Operating Area Storm Data - Weather Radar System and public 
        news media. 

      f. Satellite Pictures - Internet, public TV 

                                   8 
<<<

In addition to the DUATS, Internet and other weather providers, late-breaking 
severe weather warnings are often relayed to us through the local law 
enforcement center. 

      5.4 Seedability Forecasts - Daily Operating Decisions 

      Each day seedability forecasts will be prepared by the Project Manager 
using the information available from the sources listed in paragraph 5.3. The 
criteria described in paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 will serve as a guide in making the 
seed, no-seed decision. 

Normally, by 11:00 a.m., CDT, sufficient data are available to provide an 
indication of the weather conditions which will affect the project area for the next 
24 hours. At this time the seeding plans for the day will be telephoned to 
aircrews individually, or as a group. If seeding operations are expected, the 
crews will be given details about standby status, seeding strategy and expected 
duration of operations. If no seeding is expected on a given day, crews will be 
placed on an appropriate readiness status, always subject to immediate recall in 
the event of unpredicted severe weather. Figure 3, page 11, shows a flow chart 
of events which take place on a normal day. 

The initial daily operational decisions are made on the basis of forecast 
information, satellite data, and related upper air data. While the data inputs are 
very useful in working out crew schedules and seeding strategy, in the end the 
final seeding strategy is worked out in "real-time" by the Project Manager, his 
observations, radar information and pilot observations.

                            SEEDING CRITERIA 

 MODE - RAINFALL STIMULATION 

       Cloud Characteristics 
             Silver lodide (Agl): Cells 2.5 km, or greater in depth, growing less 
             than 500 fpm and having a maximum radar reflectivity of less than 
             45 dBz. Other cells seeded for rainfall enhancement may be 
             initiated based upon visible sightings only, irrespective of 
             reflectivity considerations. 

       Seeding Rate 
             Treat updraft areas with 3% solution of Agl at a rate of (2 grams 
             Agl) per minute or by direct injection of dry ice at a rate of (1 lb) per 
             minute into individual cells. 

MODE - HAIL SUPPRESSION 

       Cloud Characteristics 
             Silver lodide (AGI): Cells 10 km, in depth and/or growing at a rate 
             of 500 fpm, or more, or possesses a maximum radar reflectivity 
             greater than, or equal to, 45 dBz at 10,000 feet, or more, above the 
             freezing level and continues to exhibit continuous new growth 
             cloud development. 

       Seeding Rate 
       Treat updraft areas with 3% solution of Agl at a rate of (2 grams Agl) per 
       minute or by direct injection of dry ice at a rate of .4536 Kg (5 lb) per 
       minute into individual cells. 

 When atmospheric conditions indicate high potential instability, seeding for hail 
 suppression at 4 grams Agl, or more, per minute per aircraft may be performed 
 prior to seeing a radar signature indicating the presence of hail in severe storms 
providing the presence of: 

       a. A significant temperature inversion in the lower or middle levels, or 

       b. Mean winds below the inversion that are conducive to transporting the 
 seeding material into the region of expected severe storm development, 

       c. A short-term forecast that severe storms will move through the WKWM 
 target area.

                Although particular emphasis will be on the May-June period before wheat 
                harvest and while corn development is still in a relatively early growth stage, it 
                can also apply to some highly active storm days in the months of July and 
                August. In addition, pyrotechnics will be burned into updraft areas at the 
                discretion of the Program Manager. 

               6.0 SAFEGUARDS AGAINST HAZARDOUS EFFECTS 

                Although weather modification in itself is not directly hazardous, there are 
                certain precautions which should be taken against potentially contributing 
               hazards in the area of aircraft flight safety and severe weather. 

                To ensure appropriate and safe operations, the following policies will apply: 

                            (a) All pilots will be selected on the basis of integrity, experience 
                            and airmanship. 

                            (b) Prior to commencing seeding operations, pilots will be briefed 
                            on FAA traffic control and coordination procedures as they apply to 
                            the project. 

                            (c) All project aircraft will be certified air-worthy in accordance with 
                           the appropriate FAA regulations. 

                            (d) The Program Manager will attempt to keep pilots informed of 
                            storm developments that could be hazardous to them and, where 
                            appropriate, they will provide them with navigational directions 
                            needed to avoid any potential hazards observed on radar. 
                            However, pilots will always retain the final authority in all matters 
                            pertaining to flying safety including decisions to take off or to 
                            terminate any mission whenever it is judged by him that operations 
                            cannot be conducted safely.    Pilots will advise the Program 
                            Manager when they elect not to position themselves as suggested 
                            or directed for seeding purposes by the Manager. 

               7.0 EXPECTED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT 

               Based on studies of weather modification programs in states such as California, 
               Colorado, Arizona, Texas, Florida and both South and North Dakota, this project 
               does not involve any high degree of risk of harm to land, property, health or 
               ecology. 

               8.0 METHODS OF EVALUATION 

                                                   12

 8.0 METHODS OF EVALUATION 

 Although the scope and design of the proposed operational program does not 
make provisions for the extensive evaluation of seeding results, storm and 
operating data will be retained in a form suitable for later analysis. In 1994 the 
Kansas Water Office (KWO) completed an economic evaluation of the Project 
for hail suppression and, separately, an evaluation of rainfall augmentation. The 
evaluation used a Double Ratio test as the preferred method to compare a 
group of "Control" counties in Northwest Kansas and Eastern Colorado to six 
Western Kansas counties. In 1999, Brian Vulgamore conducted an economic 
evaluation of the impacts of altering precipitation and crop-damaging hail in 
western Kansas. This was done as part of the requirements for his master of 
science degree at Kansas State University. Both of these evaluations showed a 
reduction in hail from 15 to 35 percent, with no siginificant effect on rainfall. 

Copies of all aircraft flight tracks showing the times and locations of seeding are 
being sent to the Dodge City branch of the National Weather Service for an 
potential analysis. 

      8.1 Data used to Monitor Daily Operations 

            (a) Radar data (PPI and RHI files) will be archived for later 
            correlation with storm damage and aircraft positions. 

            (b) Each pilot will record on a flight form: 

               (1) Engine start and stop time 

               (2) Cloud base altitude, updraft speed and temperature 

               (3) All changes of direction of 15 degrees, or more, plotted on a 
               map of the target area 

               (4) All changes in amounts of seeding agent being dispensed 
               (one or two generators being used) 

               (5) Location at least every 15 minutes 

               (6) Gust fronts encounters 

            (c) Each pilot will verbally inform the Program Manager of: 

               (1) Cloud base altitude, updraft speed and temperature 

                                  13

I 

                              (2) All changes in amounts of seeding agent being dispensed 
                              (one or two generators being used) 

                              (3) Gust fronts encountered 

                          (d) Additionally, each pilot will plot his flight track on the reverse 
                           side of his form showing the seed and non-seed portions of the 
                          flight. Flight track data are recorded on Garmin 12 GPS systems 
                          and e-mailed to the Operations Center for eventual plotting by 
                          means of special software. 

              Flight form information is e-mailed to the field headquarters in Lakin as soon as 
              practical after flight operations. If this is not possible, the forms will be mailed no 
              later than Friday, each week. 

                    8.2 Data Collected for Research and Analysis 

                          (a) Seeding Locations and amounts 

                          (b) At least one PPI will be recorded for the archives each 10 
                          minutes, or less, during hail suppression operations and at 
                          intervals of 20 minutes, or less, during rain stimulation operations. 

                          (c) All entries will be in Central Daylight Time. Since all possess 
                          Global Positioning Systems (GPS) capability, aircraft directions will 
                          reference the magnetic compass relative to the radar-housed field 
                          headquarters at Lakin ; distance will be recorded in nautical miles 
                          from those respective headquarters. 

                    8.3 Other Reports Used to Monitor Seeding Effects 

                          (a) One of the important functions of the Policy Board members is 
                          to make continuing assessments of the impact of the seeding 
                          program in each one's area of representation. 

                          (b) Western Kansas Rainfall Reporting Network 

                          (c) Kansas-Oklahoma Crop Hail Loss Service 

                          (d) National Crop Insurance Service publication, "Direct Writings" a 
                          post-season compilation of county-level crop insurance data 
                          related to hail and fire losses.

NOTES: (1) The Program Director generally produces a weekly newsletter for 
general distribution. The newsletter divides into two section: (a) General Interest 
- where various updates, results of analyses and items thought maybe to be of a 
interest to the general public are made known, sometime related to weather 
modification, and (b) Operations - in which is reported the daily cloud seeding 
operations --- areas, times of seeding, etc. 

There is a separate section in the Operations portion reserved particularly for 
the times we seed inside Colorado. Mention is specifically made of any seeding, 
seeding amounts, time and locations on a weekly basis. The newsletter is sent 
to county commissioners, public news media and others requesting it. By 
Colorado State statutes we are obligated to make our seeding locations, times 
and amounts available to the general public in Eastern Colorado whenever we 
seed inside Colorado. As required, in the past all such information has been 
sent to Eastern Colorado county newspapers of record and to each county 
commissioner. 

 The primary intent of having a newsletter is to try to enhance public 
understanding of the public-at-large about the region's meteorological events 
and the times and locations of weather modification operations. In this regard, 
last summer the field headquarters began putting a looped radar sequence on 
its Internet web site so that interested rural and community computer users of 
the Internet could both watch in near real-time what was being seen by the radar 
system in our field headquarters (generally less than 10 minutes between 
updates). Further, it is anticipated that in 2002 the weekly newsletter will be 
placed onto the website for general public viewing.
