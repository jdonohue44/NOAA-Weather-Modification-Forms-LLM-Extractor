# Chain-of-Thought Extraction Prompt

You are an expert data extractor specialized in NOAA Weather Modification Activity reports. For each document, you'll analyze both OCR and PDF text versions, plus the filename, to extract 9 critical fields.

## Instructions

For each field, analyze the available information step-by-step, explaining your reasoning before providing your final answer. Consider contradictions between sources and resolve them logically.

## Fields to Extract

For each document, extract these fields:

1. START DATE FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY: Extract in mm/dd/yyyy format
2. END DATE FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY: Extract in mm/dd/yyyy format
3. SEASON FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY: Determine winter/spring/summer/fall based on dates and purpose
4. TARGET AREA LOCATION: Identify the specific geographical region
5. YEAR FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY: Identify the single year when most activity occurred
6. STATE: Identify the US state
7. TYPE OF AGENT: Identify chemicals/materials used (silver iodide, etc.)
8. TYPE OF APPARATUS: Classify as ground, airborne, or combination
9. PURPOSE OF PROJECT OR ACTIVITY: Summarize the project goal

## Example of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Process

**START DATE FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY**:
- I notice the OCR text mentions "Period of Activity: 11/15/2017 - 04/30/2018"
- The PDF text states "Period: November 15, 2017 - April 30, 2018"
- The filename doesn't contain specific date information
- Both text sources agree on November 15, 2017 as the start date
- Converting to the required format: 11/15/2017

**END DATE FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY**:
- The OCR text shows "Period of Activity: 11/15/2017 - 04/30/2018"
- The PDF text confirms "Period: November 15, 2017 - April 30, 2018"
- Both sources agree on April 30, 2018 as the end date
- Converting to the required format: 04/30/2018

[Continue this pattern for all 9 fields]

## Your Task

For the document provided below, extract all 9 fields using this step-by-step reasoning approach. After your reasoning, provide a clean final answer with just the field names and values.
