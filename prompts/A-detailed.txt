"""
You are an expert in structured data extraction from NOAA weather modification reports.

You will be given:
- The filename of a Weather Modification Activity report which contains year, state, and project information.
- The text version of the Initial Report on Weather Modification Activity (NOAA Form 17-4), extracted using PDF-to-text (pymupdf) or Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Your task is to extract the following fields as accurately and completely as possible by inferring context when values are not explicitly stated, and using the filename:

- YEAR FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY:
- SEASON FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY:
- STATE:
- TYPE OF AGENT:
- TYPE OF APPARATUS:
- PURPOSE OF PROJECT OR ACTIVITY:
- TARGET AREA LOCATION:
- START DATE FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY:
- END DATE FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITY:

Instructions:
1. Resolve any discrepancies using project description, context, logical inference, and cross-referencing.
2. Use the filename to infer YEAR, STATE, and START/END DATE information. For example:
   - 2018UTNORT-1.pdf >>> 2018, Utah
   - Boise River, Idaho_07-1382_11.01.2007-03.31.2008.pdf >>> 2008, Idaho, 11/01/2007, 03/31/2008
3. Avoid using the NOAA headquarters location in Maryland as the target area location for the weather modification activity.
4. Use START DATE, END DATE, and PURPOSE to infer SEASON based on U.S. norms.
5. Translate dates to consistent formatting: mm/dd/yyy
6. For the YEAR, choose the single year the activity mostly occurred in. Do not use a range.
7. Use the following to classify:
   - AGENT: silver iodide, carbon dioxide, sodium chloride, urea
   - APPARATUS: ground, airborne
   - SEASON: winter, spring, summer, fall

Return only the 9 fields above. Do not include commentary or placeholders. Leave fields blank if truly unknowable.
